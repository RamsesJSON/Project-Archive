DOT MEDITATION — V2.0 UPDATE

Just pushed a major UX overhaul to make your practice more immersive and beautiful:

What's New:

Three Themes — Toggle between Dark (original), Light (cool blue-gray), and Ink & Paper (warm parchment with serif fonts). Smooth transitions, no more color flicker.

Distraction-Free Practice — Cursor hides, timer fades out after 5s, auto-fullscreen. Space to pause, Escape to exit. Nothing between you and the dot.

Progress Bars on Cards — Set a practice goal and watch the gold bar fill up. Shows current/target hours + percentage.

Smart Stats — "Last: 2h ago" on every card. Total session count in header. Your streak shows on dashboard with fire emoji.

Visual Polish — Breathing circles on intro, floating particles, mastery badges, faster animations.

Themed Scrollbars — Subtle, minimal, matches each theme perfectly.

Reset Data — New button to wipe everything (asks twice for confirmation).

---

Still just one HTML file. Open index.html in your browser, no install needed. Data saves to localStorage.

Export your progress regularly to keep backups.

Keep your eyes on the dot.
